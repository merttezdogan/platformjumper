# ðŸŽ® Platform Jumper

This project was developed for the **Embedded Systems** course.  
It is a simple platformer-style game built as part of my coursework.

## ðŸ“¹ Demo Video

ðŸ‘‰ [Watch the demo here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI6ZSiCKuDQ)

## ðŸ§  Technologies Used

- AVR C
- Microcontroller-based input/output logic
- (Optional) Simulation tools like Proteus, Wokwi, or Tinkercad

## ðŸš€ How to Run

If you want to try the project yourself, youâ€™ll need to simulate the circuit and upload the code into the virtual environment.

You can do this using platforms such as **[Wokwi](https://wokwi.com/)** or **[Tinkercad Circuits](https://www.tinkercad.com/)** that support AVR microcontroller simulations.
